# React Ultimate Carousel

> _"The best kind of web carousel is the one you build yourself!"_

Introducing React Ultimate Carousel, a utility-first carousel for React apps that prioritizes functionality over pre-packaged features.

React Ultimate Carousel empowers you to build your carousel exactly the way you envision it. Instead of overwhelming you with a multitude of features that you may not even use, this package focuses on providing the essential functionality to your own components so that you can craft anything.

While other carousel packages may be convenient for quick implementation, they often include a plethora of features that end up bloating your builds unnecessarily.

React Ultimate Carousel gives you the tools to create all the features you want and need.

# Installation
You can install `react-ultimate-carousel` using npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install react-ultimate-carousel
```

or

```shell
yarn add react-ultimate-carousel
```

# Usage

To get started, first import the component and stylesheet:

```js
import ReactUltimateCarousel from "react-ultimate-carousel";
import "react-ultimate-carousel/lib/styles/carousel.min.css";
```

Then simply wrap your slides with the component, its important to note that each slide requires a ref to be set using the `innerRef` propery which is automatically provided by the component.

```js
const Slide = ({ innerRef, index, isActive }) => {
  return (
    <div ref={innerRef} className="slide">
      Slide {index + 1} {isActive ? "is active" : "is not active"}
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  const slides = new Array(10).fill(0);

  return (
    <ReactUltimateCarousel>
      {slides.map((_, index) => (
        <Slide key={`slide-${index}`} index={index} />
      ))}
    </ReactUltimateCarousel>
  );
};

export default App;
```
